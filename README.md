# Neith

## Overview
Neith is an in-memory time series database.  It is designed to be simple, lightweight, and perfect for IoT and microservice monitoring.

As an OSS, it is intended to be extended in ways like becoming a data sink and funnel, enhanced to production grade, or be a fun project to learn more about time series data and building a database.

## Some TODOs
- Create new ts index via commands
- Add retention policy to index
- Create query language for Neith
- Provide TCP connections for querying
- Support multiple collections (a collection holds multiple indexes)
